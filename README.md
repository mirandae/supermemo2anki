Usage:


SuperMemo's backup format is a folder like:

(((Backup of my_collection created on 2018-03-28 19-34-30)))

with a bunch of sub-folders.

so just run:

supermemo2anki absolute-path/to/(((Backup of my_collection created on 2018-03-28 19-34-30)))

uh but rename it so I don't have to deal with parentheses:


supermemo2anki path/to/bkup
